<h4>Where it all started </h4>
<p1> When I was a little girl, I always imagined myself as a great singer on stage performing all my self written songs. As I grew up, I realized that I was musically inclined and it didn't have to involve singing. I picked up the violin and played my heart out for 10 years. It wasn't until my failed musical performance audition when I realized that I had many other talents that I could focus in on. </p1></div>
<br>
<div id="div2">
<h5> Life after music </h5>
<p2>I found my love for writing, my interest in media, and also a passion for baking. I would go on to receiving my safe serve certification attempting to pursue baking. I found myself in love with baking and decorating cakes, but it just wasn't enough money to take care of myself and my three children. </p2></div>
<br>
<div id="div3">
<h6> Here I am now </h6>
<p3>I feel like I have reinvented myself many many times. And this time, it was my newfound interest in technology. I quit my day job as a baker to pursue my a+ certification. I realized that I enjoyed problem solving so much that technology would bring me the satisfaction I was seeking through my creations. </p3></div>
